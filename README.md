## How do I use it?

There are no additional dependencies: simply launch a server in the root directory and browse to index.html

## Can I get access to the underlying model and calculations

Yes! The [GRADE-DOH-model](https://github.com/stuwilmur/GRADE-DOH-model) which includes a simple API is freely available as a separate package, which allows forecasts and calculations to be performed using the GRADE model.
